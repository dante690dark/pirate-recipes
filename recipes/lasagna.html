    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking
      dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add zucchini slices; boil for 3
      minutes. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion and garlic,
      stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix bread crumbs, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, and Italian herb seasoning in a
      bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spoon 3 tablespoons tomato sauce into bottom of the prepared baking dish
      and top with 1/3 of the zucchini slices, 1/3 of the onion-garlic mixture,
      and 1/3 of the crumb-Parmesan cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice more,
      starting with 1/2 of remaining tomato sauce and layers of zucchini, onion,
      and crumb mixture. End with remaining tomato sauce in a layer; sprinkle
      1/4 cup Parmesan cheese over the top.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until lasagna begins to bubble, about 30
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat oven's broiler and broil the lasagna until cheese topping is
      browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Let casserole stand for 15 minutes to set before
      serving.
